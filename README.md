# Wordle
This is my version of wordle using html, css. and vanilla javascript! (With a few twists)

## Approach Taken
I started off making sure that my html was well organized so I could easily manipulate everything I would need in javascript. I then tackled the logic for a regular game of wordle, trying to keep everything defined with variables in order to incorperate different word lengths. I started with generating the boxes and keyboard, then filling in the boxes correctly, and checking/coloring last. I used 2 API's, one to generate the random word, and one to check any user inputs.

After that, I worked on adding features like lightning mode, a slider for variable word lengths, a stats tab, and info page, and a refresh method.

## Installation Instructions
There are none!

## Unsolved Problems
There is currently a bug where words generated by the random word api are not recognized in my dictionary api.
